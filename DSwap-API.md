#### Swap Request BTC LTC BCH DOGE SWIFT
An important notice if the INPUT TOKEN is a BTC-forked crypto token is that the Deposit address for the INPUT TOKEN must be retrieved from the converter endpoint for the DSwap account. IMPORTANT: You need to send the dswap account name as "destination" parameter. Because that's the account being used to retrieve and convert deposits.

- example retrieving deposit address from the converter:
```
const request = await this.http.fetch(`${environment.CONVERTER_API_HE}convert/`, {
	method: 'POST',
	body: json({ 
		from_coin: 'BTC', 
		to_coin: 'SWAP.BTC', 
		destination: 'dswap' }) 
});

const response = await request.json();
```
The response of the converter contains a uniquely generated address to which the user needs to deposit the BTC, LTC etc. token:
```
response:
{
	"ex_rate":1.0,
	"destination":"dswap",
	"pair":"BTC -> SWAP.BTC (1.0000 SWAP.BTC per BTC)",
	"address":"bc1qs7eu9m3feu2e5gsnjtjp5wnj8yyv7kg6lmrs88"
}
```

- The swap request for this SWAP from BTC --> DEC would look like:
```
{    
    "Account": "lion200",
    "TokenInput": "BTC",
    "TokenInputAmount": 10,
    "TokenOutput": "DEC",
    "TokenOutputAmount": 1764507.455,
    "SwapSourceId": "5fab0821cdef24759c5ae9a9",
    "ChainTransactionId": "", 
    "Chain": 1,
    "MaxSlippageInputToken": 5,
    "MaxSlippageOutputToken": 5,
    "BaseTokenAmount": 6450.599625154223,
    "TokenInputMemo": "bc1qs7eu9m3feu2e5gsnjtjp5wnj8yyv7kg6lmrs88" -- This is the unique deposit address generated & retrieved from the converter API endpoint above.
}
```

#### Swap Request BTS EOS
For BitShares EOS like crypto tokens the converter API is returning a generic deposit address where the user can make his/her deposit.
In order to make this deposit unique and match this deposit to a swap request, you need to add a unique identifier in the MEMO of your deposit.

- For BTS and EOS, the crypto converter request looks like:
```
const request = await this.http.fetch(`${environment.CONVERTER_API_HE}convert/`, {
	method: 'POST',
	body: json({ 
		from_coin: 'BTS', 
		to_coin: 'SWAP.BTS', 
		destination: 'dswap' }) 
});

const response = await request.json();
```
And the response looks like:
```
Response: 
{
	"ex_rate":1.0,
	"destination":"dswap",
	"pair":"BTS -> SWAP.BTS (1.0000 SWAP.BTS per BTS)",
	"memo":"SWAP.BTS dswap",
	"account":"steem-engine"
}
```

As you can see in the response of the converter. The deposit needs to happen to "steem-engine" address with memo "SWAP.BTS dswap".
Because this memo is very generic and we actually need to make this deposit unique to the Swap Requestor, the memo should contain a GUID (unique identifier), which should be looking like: 

```
Deposit address: steem-engine
Memo: SWAP.BTS dswap 1cdc54b3-45b2-44fe-a254-912f1cfa7892
```

This unique identifier also needs to be provided to the Swap Request as **TokenInputMemo** which would result in the following request:
```
{
	"Account":"lion200",
	"Chain":1,
	"ChainTransactionId":"",
	"TokenOutput":"DEC",
	"TokenOutputAmount":5.944,
	"TokenInput":"BTS",
	"TokenInputAmount":1,
	"SwapSourceId":"5fab0821cdef24759c5ae9a9",
	"BaseTokenAmount":0.02,
	"MaxSlippageInputToken":5,
	"MaxSlippageOutputToken":5,
	"TokenInputMemo":"1cdc54b3-45b2-44fe-a254-912f1cfa7892" -- Unique identifier
}
```

After creating the swap request, the user still needs to deposit BTS by using the following details obviously: 
```
Deposit address: steem-engine (Retrieved from the Converter API)
Memo: SWAP.BTS dswap 1cdc54b3-45b2-44fe-a254-912f1cfa7892
```

#### Swap Request HBD SBD STEEM
The swap request requirements for HBD, SBD, STEEM are comparable to the swap request requirements for BTS and EOS.
The only difference is that the deposit address for BTS and EOS retrieved from the Converter API is **steem-engine** and for HBD, SBD and STEEM this deposit address is **graphene-swap**.

So the Swap Request paramters are just like the request for BTS and EOS containing a unique identifier given in TokenInputMemo field.
The only difference is that the user needs to manually deposit HBD, SBD or STEEM using following details:

```
Deposit address: graphene-swap (Retrieved from the Converter API)
Memo: SWAP.STEEM dswap 785d9da6-b3f2-4732-8dd2-672131ee9991
```
