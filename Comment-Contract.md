# Introduction

The comments contract allows a token issuer to set up
a post reward system
that allows stakers to assign value to posts on the
main chain. The voting mechanism mirrors that of 
Steem/Hive, with a few notable differences:

* Separate upvote/downvote voting power. How much a
  full power vote affects the value as well as how
  fast the power is consumed, and the regeneration
  time are all configurable.
* Does not use mana system where powered up stake is
  immediately usable.

# Voting System

The voting system uses a user's staked and delegated token amounts, along with voting power, to determine how much value a vote assigns to a given post.

Voting power is a numeric value between 0 and 10000, and each vote consumes an amount proportional to the vote weight. Roughly, a full 100% vote consumes (`votePowerConsumption / 10000`) fraction of the current voting power. Voting power replenishes at a linear rate configured by `voteRegenerationDays`.

Downvoting has a separate independently configured voting power.

Votes assign a certain quantity called rshares to the post which is determined from multiplying the consumed voting power by the user's stake (+delegated).

To determine the post value, we apply the reward curve to the rshares total, divide by pendingClaims (accumulated curved rshare total of posts in a (`cashoutWindowDays * 2`) window), and multiply by the rewardPool.

Every vote operation triggers a maintenance action that adds to the reward pool in accordance with the configured schedule, and pays out any posts that have cashoutTime in the past.


# Actions available:

### createRewardPool:
Create a new reward pool. A creation fee of 1000 BEE is required.
For now, only one reward pool per token is allowed.

* requires active key: yes
* can be called by: token issuer
* parameters:

  * config (object): Reward pool configuration
    * config.postRewardCurve (string): Post reward curve. Options are: "power" (r^a)
    * config.postRewardCurveParameter (BigNumber): Post reward curve parameter. For "power" curve, this is the exponent, "a" of "r^a". Use "1" for linear. The decimal precision of this parameter can be at most 2.
    * config.curationRewardCurve (string): Post reward curve. Options are: "power" (r^a)
    * config.curationRewardCurveParameter (BigNumber): Post reward curve parameter. For "power" curve, this is the exponent, "a" of "r^a". Use "1" for linear. The decimal precision of this parameter can be at most 2.

* requires active key: yes
* can be called by: token issuer
* parameters:
  * rewardPoolId (id): ID of pool to modify.
  * active (boolean): Whether the pool is active.

* examples:
```
{
    "contractName": "comments",
    "contractAction": "setActive",
    "contractPayload": {
        "rewardPoolId": 1,
        "active": true
    }
}
```

### comment

This action cannot be called with custom json or by other
means.
* parameters:
  * author (string): Author of comment, derived from comment op sender.
  * permlink (string): Permlink of comment, derived from comment op.
  * rewardPools (array of integer): List of reward poolIDs. Can be specified if attaching using a hive engine transaction to the comment op via json_metadata.ssc.transactions[]. Will only accept the first params.maxPoolsPerPost reward pools.
  * parentAuthor (string): Parent author of comment, derived from comment op parent_author. Note that replies to indexed posts are automaticaly indexed as well to the same reward pools.
  * parentPermlink (string): Parent permlink of comment, derived from comment op parent_permlink. Used by main chain to specify community category.
  * jsonMetadata (object): Metadata of comment, derived from comment op json_metadata, used for deciding whether to index the comment. Specifically, we look up reward pools corresponding to json_metadata.tags.

* examples:
```
{

    "contractPayload": {
         "author": "author",
         "permlink": "permlink",
         "rewardPoolIds": [1,2],
    }
}
```

A successful action will emit a "newComment" event for each reward pool, e.g.:
```
{
    "contract": "comments",
    "event": "newComment",
    "data": {
        "rewardPoolId": 1,
        "symbol": "TKN",
    }
}
```

  * beneficiaries (array): Beneficiaries, derived from comment_options 
    * beneficiaries[].account: Account of beneficiary.
    * beneficiaries[].weight: Determines what percentage of the author reward to go to the beneficiary account. Must be an integer from 1 to 10000

### vote
Automatic action derived from vote op on main chain.
This action cannot be called with custom json or by other means.
* parameters
  * voter (string): Voter of vote op.
  * author (string): Author of comment to vote.
  * permlink (string): Permlink of comment to vote.
  * weight (integer): Weight of vote, out of 10000.

A successful action will emit a "newVote" or an "updateVote" event for each reward pool with the rshares added to the post, e.g.:
```
{
    "contract": "comments",
    "event": "newVote",
    "data": {
        "rewardPoolId": 1,
        "symbol": "TKN",
        "rshares": "2.1084201919",
    }
}
```

### tokenMaintenance
Not an action, but automatically performed before processing a comment action, once per block. Processes posts that are pending payout at a rate determined by `maintenanceTokensPerBlock` and `maxPostsProcessedPerRound`.

Note that after payout, the post and votes objects are deleted, but they emit events for how much authors, curators, and beneficiaries are paid:

```
{
    "contract": "comments",
    "event": "authorReward",
    "data": {
        "rewardPoolId": 1,
        "authorperm": "@author/perm"
```

  * updateFee: the cost in BEE to update a pool
  * maxPoolsPerPost: max number of reward pools a comment can be part of.
  * maxTagsPerPool: max number of tags a reward pool config can specify.
  * maintenenaceTokensPerBlock: number of tokens that can do reward maintenance per block that contains a comment op.
  * lastMaintenanceBlock: last sidechain block where maintenance occurred.
  * maxPostsProcessedPerRound: max number of posts to pay out each maintenance round.
  * voteQueryLimit: number of votes to process at a time (e.g. the limit parameter in fetching votes to pay out for a post). Defaults to 1000.
