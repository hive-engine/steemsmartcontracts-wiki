# Introduction

The mining contract allows a token issuer to set up "mining pools" that give
token stakers a chance to earn tokens via a lottery system. The issuer creates
a mining pool, specifying how often a lottery occurs, how many winners, and how
many tokens should be distributed each round, and the contract system handles
the rest. This is how "Proof of Stake" and "Proof of Staked Mining" works on
the scotbot level, and this contract can be viewed as a replacement of that
functionality. 

# Actions available:

### createPool:
Create a new mining pool. A creation fee of 1000 BEE is required. Note you
can specify the same token as the mining token, in which case it behaves like
'proof of stake', or you can specify a different token, in which case it
behaves like 'proof of staked mining'. You can also specify up to two mining
tokens with different multipliers. For example, for a pool with TEST as the
mined token and TEST, TESTM as the mining tokens with multipliers 1 and 4,
respectively, someone with 10 TEST stake and 10 TESTM stake will have a
mining power of 50. Note that delegated stake counts for this calculation.
For each lottery, the probability that someone will be a winner is their
mining power divided by the total mining power.

Note also that there can only be one pool per combination of mined token and
mining tokens. Upon creation, the mining ID derived from these symbols is
assigned to the pool.

* requires active key: yes
* can be called by: token issuer
* parameters:
  * lotteryWinners (integer >= 1 and <= 20): Number of lottery winners per round.
  * lotteryIntervalHours (integer >= 1 and <= 720): How often in hours to run a lottery.
  * lotteryAmount (string): Amount to pay out per round. Split among `lotteryWinners` winners.
  * minedToken (string): Which token to mine.
  * tokenMiners (list): List of token miners (at most 2 allowed)
    * tokenMiners[].symbol (string): Symbol of token that is mining.
    * tokenMiners[].multiplier (integer >= 1 and <= 100): Multiplier for mining token.
  * nftTokenMiner: NFT Token miner (optional)
    * nftTokenMiner.symbol (string):  Symbol of token that is mining.
    * nftTokenMiner.typeField (string): Property of nft to use to distinguish nft types.
    * nftTokenMiner.properties (list): List of properties for pwoer computation.
      * nftTokenMiner.properties.op: ADD or MULTIPLY whether to add or multiply the
         power values for this property.

        * nftTokenMiner.properties.burnChange.symbol: Symbol of burned token.
        * nftTokenMiner.properties.burnChange.quantity: Quantity of burned token for fee. The fee
            to change this property is the amount desired multiplied by this quantity.
    * nftTokenMiner.typeMap (object): Map type to power attributes. Value should match
         order of the properties list, and they should be BigNumber-compatible strings.

* parameters:
  * id (string): ID of pool to modify.
  * type (string): Type of NFT to modify.
  * propertyName (string): Name of property to modify.
