# Steem & Hive Smart Contracts Wiki

**Getting started with Engine smart contract development**: first, read all the links below in the **General System Design & Usage** section. Steem is mentioned in some areas, but everything is equally applicable to Hive Engine. After that, read the [Smart Contract Developer's Guide](https://github.com/hive-engine/steemsmartcontracts-wiki/blob/master/Smart-Contracts-Guide.md), which contains quickstart instructions and teaches you best practices for working with & testing smart contract code. Use the **Contract Documentation** section as a reference for individual smart contract interfaces.
